    Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily who lived in a small village. 
    Lily was a kind and gentle girl, and she loved to help others. 
    One day, Lily was walking through the forest when she came across a lost puppy. 
    The puppy was scared and alone, and Lily knew she had to help.
     She picked up the puppy and took it home with her.

    Lily gave the puppy a bath and some food, and she soon realized that the puppy was a girl.
     Lily named the puppy Hope, and the two of them quickly became best friends.
      Lily and Hope spent their days playing together in the forest, and they always looked out for each other.

    One day, Lily and Hope were playing in the forest when they came across a group of bullies. 
    The bullies started to pick on Lily, but Hope stood up to them. She barked and growled at the bullies, 
    and they eventually ran away. Lily was so grateful to Hope for protecting her, 
    and she knew that she would always have a friend in her.
